The basic logic of my code consists of:

requirements.txt
main.py
app.py

"API" folder ~  __init__.py (empty as others)  ,   endpoints.py

"models" folder
|__  __init__.py 
|__ calculator.py
|__ location.py
|__ order.py

"tests" folder       #empty, because the whole code isn;t completed yet
|__ __init__.py
|__ api_test.py 
|__ calculator_test.py
