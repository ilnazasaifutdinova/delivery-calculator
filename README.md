Building a DOPC ~ Delivery Order Price Calculator as a case for Wolt internship program 2025


The basic logic of my code consists of:

requirements.txt
main.py
app.py

"API" folder
|__  __init__.py     #it's by default empty, so this type of code won't be downloaded. 
|__  endpoints.py

"models" folder
|__  __init__.py 
|__ calculator.py
|__ location.py
|__ order.py

"tests" folder       #empty, because the whole code isn;t completed yet
|__ __init__.py
|__ api_test.py 
|__ calculator_test.py
