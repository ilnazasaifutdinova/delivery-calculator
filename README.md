Building a DOPC ~ Delivery Order Price Calculator as a case for Wolt internship program 2025


The basic logic of my code consists of:

1) requirements.txt

2) main.py

3) app.py

4) "API" folder ~  __init__.py (empty as others)  ,   endpoints.py

5) "models" folder ~  __init__.py  ,  calculator.py  ,   location.py  ,   order.py

#empty, because the whole code isn't completed yet

6)  "tests" folder  ~  __init__.py  ,   api_test.py  ,  calculator_test.py
